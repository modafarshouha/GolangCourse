# Programming with Google Go (Univeristy of California, Irvine - 3 courses specialization):
This specialization introduces the Go programming language from Google and provides learners with an overview of Go's special features. Upon completing the three-course sequence, learners will have gained the knowledge and skills needed to create concise, efficient, and clean applications using Go.


## Golang getting started: (https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started/home/welcome)

### helloWorld:
Download and install the Go tools on your machine. Write a Go program to print “Hello, world!” on the screen. Compile and run the program.
Submit a screenshot of your cmd window showing you compiling and executing your code. The string “Hello, world!” should appear on the screen when you execute the code.

### trunc:
Write a program which prompts the user to enter a floating point number and prints the integer which is a truncated version of the floating point number that was entered. Truncation is the process of removing the digits to the right of the decimal place.

### findIAN:
Write a program which prompts the user to enter a string. The program searches through the entered string for the characters ‘i’, ‘a’, and ‘n’. The program should print “Found!” if the entered string starts with the character ‘i’, ends with the character ‘n’, and contains the character ‘a’. The program should print “Not Found!” otherwise. The program should not be case-sensitive, so it does not matter if the characters are upper-case or lower-case.
Examples: The program should print “Found!” for the following example entered strings, “ian”, “Ian”, “iuiygaygn”, “I d skd a efju N”. The program should print “Not Found!” for the following strings, “ihhhhhn”, “ina”, “xian”. 

### slice:
Write a program which prompts the user to enter integers and stores the integers in a sorted slice. The program should be written as a loop. Before entering the loop, the program should create an empty integer slice of size (length) 3. During each pass through the loop, the program prompts the user to enter an integer to be added to the slice. The program adds the integer to the slice, sorts the slice, and prints the contents of the slice in sorted order. The slice must grow in size to accommodate any number of integers which the user decides to enter. The program should only quit (exiting the loop) when the user enters the character ‘X’ instead of an integer.

### makeJSON:
Write a program which prompts the user to first enter a name, and then enter an address. Your program should create a map and add the name and address to the map using the keys “name” and “address”, respectively. Your program should use Marshal() to create a JSON object from the map, and then your program should print the JSON object.

### read:
Write a program which reads information from a file and represents it in a slice of structs. Assume that there is a text file which contains a series of names. Each line of the text file has a first name and a last name, in that order, separated by a single space on the line. 

Your program will define a name struct which has two fields, fname for the first name, and lname for the last name. Each field will be a string of size 20 (characters).

Your program should prompt the user for the name of the text file. Your program will successively read each line of the text file and create a struct which contains the first and last names found in the file. Each struct created will be added to a slice, and after all lines have been read from the file, your program will have a slice containing one struct for each line in the file. After reading all lines from the file, your program should iterate through your slice of structs and print the first and last names found in each struct.


## Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go: (https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-functions-methods/home/welcome)

### BubbleSort:
Write a Bubble Sort program in Go. The program should prompt the user to type in a sequence of up to 10 integers. The program should print the integers out on one line, in sorted order, from least to greatest. Use your favorite search tool to find a description of how the bubble sort algorithm works.
As part of this program, you should write a function called BubbleSort() which takes a slice of integers as an argument and returns nothing. The BubbleSort() function should modify the slice so that the elements are in sorted order.

A recurring operation in the bubble sort algorithm is the Swap operation which swaps the position of two adjacent elements in the slice. You should write a Swap() function which performs this operation. Your Swap() function should take two arguments, a slice of integers and an index value i which indicates a position in the slice. The Swap() function should return nothing, but it should swap the contents of the slice in position i with the contents in position i+1.

### Displacement:
Let us assume the following formula for displacement s as a function of time t, acceleration a, initial velocity vo, and initial displacement so.
s = ½ a t2 + vot + so

Write a program which first prompts the user to enter values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement.
Then the program should prompt the user to enter a value for time and the program should compute the displacement after the entered time.

You will need to define and use a function called GenDisplaceFn() which takes three float64 arguments, acceleration a, initial velocity vo, and initial displacement so. GenDisplaceFn() should return a function which computes displacement as a function of time, assuming the given values acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement. The function returned by GenDisplaceFn() should take one float64 argument t, representing time, and return one float64 argument which is the displacement travelled after time t.

For example, let’s say that I want to assume the following values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement: a = 10, vo = 2, so = 1. I can use the following statement to call GenDisplaceFn() to generate a function fn which will compute displacement as a function of time.
fn := GenDisplaceFn(10, 2, 1)

Then I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 3 seconds.
fmt.Println(fn(3))

And I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 5 seconds.
fmt.Println(fn(5))

### Animal:
Write a program which allows the user to get information about a predefined set of animals. Three animals are predefined, cow, bird, and snake. Each animal can eat, move, and speak. The user can issue a request to find out one of three things about an animal: 1) the food that it eats, 2) its method of locomotion, and 3) the sound it makes when it speaks. The following table contains the three animals and their associated data which should be hard-coded into your program.

  | Animal | Food eaten  | Locomotion method  | Spoken sound | 
  | ------ | ----------  | -----------------  | -----------  |
  |  cow   |    grass    |       walk         | 	moo		 |
  |  bird  |    worms    |       fly          | 	peep	 |
  |  snake |    mice     |       slither      | 	hsss	 |

Your program should present the user with a prompt, “>”, to indicate that the user can type a request. Your program accepts one request at a time from the user, prints out the answer to the request, and prints out a new prompt. Your program should continue in this loop forever. Every request from the user must be a single line containing 2 strings. The first string is the name of an animal, either “cow”, “bird”, or “snake”. The second string is the name of the information requested about the animal, either “eat”, “move”, or “speak”. Your program should process each request by printing out the requested data.

You will need a data structure to hold the information about each animal. Make a type called Animal which is a struct containing three fields:food, locomotion, and noise, all of which are strings. Make three methods called Eat(), Move(), and Speak(). The receiver type of all of your methods should be your Animal type. The Eat() method should print the animal’s food, the Move() method should print the animal’s locomotion, and the Speak() method should print the animal’s spoken sound. Your program should call the appropriate method when the user makes a request.

### InterfaceAnimal:
Write a program which allows the user to create a set of animals and to get information about those animals. Each animal has a name and can be either a cow, bird, or snake. With each command, the user can either create a new animal of one of the three types, or the user can request information about an animal that he/she has already created. Each animal has a unique name, defined by the user. Note that the user can define animals of a chosen type, but the types of animals are restricted to either cow, bird, or snake. The following table contains the three types of animals and their associated data.

  | Animal | Food eaten  | Locomotion method  | Spoken sound | 
  | ------ | ----------  | -----------------  | -----------  |
  |  cow   |    grass    |       walk         | 	moo		 |
  |  bird  |    worms    |       fly          | 	peep	 |
  |  snake |    mice     |       slither      | 	hsss	 |

Your program should present the user with a prompt, “>”, to indicate that the user can type a request. Your program should accept one command at a time from the user, print out a response, and print out a new prompt on a new line. Your program should continue in this loop forever. Every command from the user must be either a “newanimal” command or a “query” command.

Each “newanimal” command must be a single line containing three strings. The first string is “newanimal”. The second string is an arbitrary string which will be the name of the new animal. The third string is the type of the new animal, either “cow”, “bird”, or “snake”.  Your program should process each newanimal command by creating the new animal and printing “Created it!” on the screen.

Each “query” command must be a single line containing 3 strings. The first string is “query”. The second string is the name of the animal. The third string is the name of the information requested about the animal, either “eat”, “move”, or “speak”. Your program should process each query command by printing out the requested data.

Define an interface type called Animal which describes the methods of an animal. Specifically, the Animal interface should contain the methods Eat(), Move(), and Speak(), which take no arguments and return no values. The Eat() method should print the animal’s food, the Move() method should print the animal’s locomotion, and the Speak() method should print the animal’s spoken sound. Define three types Cow, Bird, and Snake. For each of these three types, define methods Eat(), Move(), and Speak() so that the types Cow, Bird, and Snake all satisfy the Animal interface. When the user creates an animal, create an object of the appropriate type. Your program should call the appropriate method when the user issues a query command.
